Package: ZOIP
Title: ZOIP Distribution, ZOIP Regression, ZOIP Mixed Regression
Description: The ZOIP distribution (Zeros Ones Inflated Proportional) is a proportional data distribution inflated with zeros and/or ones, this distribution is defined on the most known proportional data distributions, the beta and simplex distribution, JÃ¸rgensen and Barndorff-Nielsen (1991) <doi:10.1016/0047-259X(91)90008-P>, also allows it to have different parameterizations of the beta distribution, Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004) <doi:10.1080/0266476042000214501>, Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005) <doi:10.18637/jss.v023.i07>. The ZOIP distribution has four parameters, two of which correspond to the proportion of zeros and ones, and the other two correspond to the distribution of the proportional data of your choice. The 'ZOIP' package allows adjustments of regression models for fixed and mixed effects for proportional data inflated with zeros and/or ones.
