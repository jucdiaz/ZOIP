Title: ZOIP Distribution, ZOIP Regression, ZOIP Mixed Regression
Description: 'ZOIP' (Zeros Ones Inflated Proportional) distribution is a distribution for proporcional data inflated with zeros and/or ones, this distribution is definited about the distributions for proportional data more known, the distribution beta and simplex, JÃ¸rgensen and Barndorff-Nielsen (1991) <doi:10.1016/0047-259X(91)90008-P>, in addition it allows that have different parameterizations of the beta distribution, Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004) <doi:10.1080/0266476042000214501>, Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005) <doi:10.18637/jss.v023.i07>. The 'ZOIP' distribution has four parameters, two of which correspond to the proportion of zeros and ones some, the other two corresponding to the distribution for proportional data of their choice. The "ZOIP package" allows for adjustments of regression models for fixed and mixed effects for proportional data inflated with zeros and/or ones.
